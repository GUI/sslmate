sslmate is the command line client for SSLMate <https://sslmate.com>, a
service for purchasing and managing SSL certificates.  SSLMate provides
easy-to-use tools for buying, renewing, and revoking certificates, for
monitoring the expiration date of your certificates, and for synchronizing
your certificates between your servers.

SSLMate emphasizes speed, ease-of-use, and automation.  For example, the
command to purchase a certificate (sslmate buy) typically completes in
under a minute and automates the steps of generating a private key,
generating a CSR, and building a certificate bundle.  SSLMate can
automatically renew your certificates, and you can run sslmate download
from a cron job so that renewed certificates are automatically downloaded
to your server.

To use the sslmate command, you must create a free account at
